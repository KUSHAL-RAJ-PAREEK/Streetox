# StreetOx

🌟 Presenting StreetOx: Connecting Communities, Delivering Possibilities! 🌟

We’re thrilled to share **StreetOx**, our concept app designed to foster stronger communities and make sharing resources easier than ever. And we are very happy to roll out its Beta version to specific users.

## 🎯 What is StreetOx?
StreetOx is an idea built around the power of communities. If you need something, all you have to do is raise a request through the app.
1️⃣ Nearby users receive a notification about your request.  
2️⃣ Someone on their way can bring the item to you.  
3️⃣ The helper earns a small reward, called **toffee money** (cash in the form of tokens).  

## 💡 How did we come up with this?
Our team – [**Kushal Raj Pareek**](https://github.com/KUSHAL-RAJ-PAREEK), [**Krunal Lohar**](https://github.com/Krunallohar), and [**Neeraj Verma**](https://github.com/NeerajVermaGPS) – wanted to address a common problem: the lack of easy ways to connect and share resources in local communities. After brainstorming, we developed this concept to simplify how people help each other.

We’re also extremely grateful for the guidance of our mentor, [**Apporva Bansal**](https://github.com/AppoorvaBansal), whose support has been invaluable throughout this project.
